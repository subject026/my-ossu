Diving into implementation big cause of project failure

Take time for forming requirements and create a design

## Requirements

Conditions and capabilities set by client - what they want. Also important to establish potential trade offs.

Eliciting requirements involves listening but asking questions to clarify what you're not being told.

Once established can serve as a foundation for design.


## Design

The clearer the conceptual design the better the technical design.

#### Conceptual

- Produce conceptual mock ups recognising the appropriate components, connections and responsibilities of the product and it's components
- Not concerned with any technical detail just high level concepts
- Think about how product with work and be used
- Common for UI mock ups to be produced

#### Technical

- Produce technical diagrams
- specify technical details of each component
- done by splitting components down until each component can be designed in detail
- components break down into collections of classes, functions or other components
- small pieces represent much simpler problems
